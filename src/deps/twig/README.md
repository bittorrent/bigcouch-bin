Twig is a SASL-compliant Erlang/OTP logger.  It installs a gen_event handler in the error_logger event manager, where it consumes standard OTP reports and messages as well as events generated by twig:log/2,3,4.  Log messages are written to a syslog server over UDP using the format specified in RFC 5424.

Twig's behavior is controlled using the application environment:

* host (undefined): the hostname of the syslog server
* port (514): the port of the syslog server
* facility (local2): syslog facility to be used
* level (info): logging threshold. Messages "above" this threshold (in syslog parlance) will be discarded. Acceptable values are debug, info, notice, warn, err, crit, alert, and emerg.
* appid ("twig"): inserted as the APPID in the syslog message
* max_term_size (8192): raw data size below which we format normally
* max_message_size (16000): approx. max size of truncated string
